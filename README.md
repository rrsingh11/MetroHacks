#### In today‚Äôs world, there are many technological advancements in the medical field. Doctors have found ways to deal with diseases and provides effective solutions. However, it is very hard for patients to locate hospitals near them that provide the necessary resources, especially in emergencies. This inspired us to create MedCheck, a web platform that is designed to show the available resources at the nearby hospital(s) within the perimeter of the user's location. With this website, we hope to help patients receive the care they need.

## üè•About The Project:
This project monitors and optimizes the available resources in hospitals and makes them accessible to the people. It helps humans find a nearby hospital with enough resources for their treatment. This is a great platform to solve the problem of people suffering from the unavailability of resources.
Another fantastic feature of this project is that a user can chat with a well-trained AI bot to relax their mood, and this helps in avoiding Depression, Anxiety & Mental illness.

## ‚úèÔ∏èHow does it work?
This project aims to help patients with the unavailability of resources. The user needs to search nearby hospitals, and they can check the availability of resources within two clicks. Another excellent functionality of this product is that they can chat with the AI bot to lighten their mood and share their feelings with them.
Hospitals have to sign up with their affiliated id, and they will receive a unique id and then can update resources using their unique id and password. It is a simple and efficient workflow for monitoring and operating the available resources.


## üî≠Future of the project
We will look to scale this project. We are planning to create a mobile application as well for easy access. Further, we'll work on improving the UI and use optimized AI/ML implementation to give users a better experience. With time we will gather more data and scale the product to the global level. Integrating it with more hospitals will be our top priority.
We will also ease down the process of sharing resources among hospitals and record it with the help of Blockchain.
